# CarHub Landing Page

## Purpose
The **CarHub** landing page is designed to serve as the main entry point for users looking to explore the latest cars, reviews, buying guides, and car insurance information. It aims to provide an intuitive and clean user experience with quick navigation to key sections like **Car Reviews**, **Car Buying Guides**, **Car Insurance**, and more.

## Framework Usage

This project utilizes **Tailwind CSS** for styling, ensuring a responsive and modern design. Below is an overview of the sections that leverage Tailwind:

- **Header and Navigation Bar**: Tailwind utility classes are used to create a responsive navigation bar with hover effects and spacing.
- **Main Content Section**: Tailwind's `flex`, `absolute`, `relative`, and `object-cover` utilities are used to structure the layout, with a background image and text overlay.
- **About Section**: Tailwind's grid system (`grid-cols-1`, `sm:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-4`) is used to create a responsive layout with cards for the different sections like Car Reviews, Buying Guides, etc.
- **Footer Section**: Tailwind is used to create a simple, centered footer with social media links and a copyright notice.

### Key Tailwind Classes Used:
- `bg-gray-100`, `bg-blue-900`, `bg-white` for background colors
- `text-blue-900`, `text-red-600`, `text-white` for text colors
- `flex`, `grid`, `items-center`, `justify-center` for layout control
- `shadow-lg`, `rounded-lg`, `hover:bg-gray-300` for styling components

**No external frameworks like Bootstrap** are used in this project.
